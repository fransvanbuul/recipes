# Personal Recipes

This is where I keep a number of things I need to have / lookup on a regular basis, mainly related
to developing Axon systems.

If you find anything useful: great. Also be aware that this is highly personal/opinionated,
may or may not be maintained, etc.

Please look at [https://axoniq.io/download] and [https://docs.axoniq.io] for the official Axon 
getting started info.
